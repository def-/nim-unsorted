# You can define your own infix operators:

proc `^`*[T: SomeInteger](base: T, exp: T): T =
  var (base, exp) = (base, exp)
  result = 1

  while exp != 0:
    if (exp and 1) != 0:
      result *= base
    exp = exp shr 1
    base *= base

echo 2 ^ 10 # 1024

# "when" is a compile time "if" and can be used to prevent code from
# even being parsed at compile time, for example to write platform
# specific code:

when defined windows:
  echo "Call some Windows specific functions here"
elif defined linux:
  echo "Call some Linux specific functions here"
else:
  echo "Code for the other platforms"

# Normal code can be executed at compile time if it is in a static block:

static:
  echo "Hello Compile time world: ", 2 ^ 10

# As well as stored in compile time constants:

const x = 2 ^ 10

# Template calls are replaced at compile time.

import os

const debug = false

proc expensive: string =
  sleep(milsecs = 100)
  result = "That was difficult"

# The expensive() procedure has to be evaluated even when debug is false:
block:
  proc log(msg: string) =
    if debug:
      echo msg

  for i in 1..10:
    log expensive()

# This can be prevented using templates:
block:
  template log(msg: string) =
    if debug:
      echo msg

  for i in 1..10:
    log expensive()

# Templates have a special syntax for use with statement parameters:

template times(x, y) =
  for i in 1..x:
    y

10.times: # or times 10:
  echo "hi"
  echo "bye"

# Term Rewriting Templates can be used to write your own optimizations:

block:
  template optLog1{a and a}(a): auto = a
  template optLog2{a and (b or (not b))}(a,b): auto = a
  template optLog3{a and not a}(a: int): auto = 0

  var
    x = 12
    s = x and x
    # Hint: optLog1(x) --> ’x’ [Pattern]

    r = (x and x) and ((s or s) or (not (s or s)))
    # Hint: optLog2(x and x, s or s) --> ’x and x’ [Pattern]
    # Hint: optLog1(x) --> ’x’ [Pattern]

    q = (s and not x) and not (s and not x)
    # Hint: optLog3(s and not x) --> ’0’ [Pattern]

# The most powerful metaprogramming capabilities are offered by
# Macros. They can generate source code or even an AST directly.
# dumpTree can be useful when creating an AST, as it shows you the AST
